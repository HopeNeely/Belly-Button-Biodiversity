## Belly Button Biodiversity

![Bacteria by filterforge.com](Images/bacteria.jpg)

In this challenge, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Check out this interactive dashboard at hopeneely.github.io/Plotly-challenge. The dropdown allows the user to select an individual test subject ID nubmer. That selection updates the demographic information, the horizontal bar chart, and the bubble chart to show information for that individual test subject.
